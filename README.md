# Guardian 
Guardian is an SPA-application that is made for saving credintials easily and securely
This is an application developed as a hobby project.
New things I learned while coding this app:
- More about mongodb schema validation
- Better way of handling errors in the front-end
- Multi-factor authentication using email address
- More about Vue component life cycle hooks
- Nestjs Interceptors
... and many more smaller things.

## Tech stack
I tried to avoid using multiple technologies and a lot of libraries. Here are basically all of the tools I used.
- Vue (alongside Vuetify)
- NestJs (with nodemailer for emailing and a plugin of nestjs for scheduling tasks)  
- Mongoose

## What is next? 
I will sometimes come back to this app and see if I can make it even more functional by adding more features.  
If you liked it please consider starring this reporistory. I would appreciate it :)
